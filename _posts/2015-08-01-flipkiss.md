## Summary
With a team of five I invented and launched a small but cute matching iOS game. Flipkiss was featured by Apple for "New Games We Love" in several countries like the USA, Germany, United Kingdom & Spain. The game is conntected to a social cause. With Flippkiss I wanted to raise awareness and funds for research for people affected by Lupus, an incurable autoimmune disease.

## Initial Idea & First Designs
The idea started in 2014 while I was having a shower and looking at the tiles in the bathroom.

>"If I would turn one tile I could match two that have a similair mark and make them disappear… The match is a kiss… I flipped the tile… the game will be called Flipkiss!" 

That's pretty much what happened in my head. I immediately grabbed some Post-Its and Sharpies and created the first paper prototype.

It felt as if I was onto something. So I went straight to the computer and came up with a first design draft.

## The Journey
The idea and the designs were just the start for a journey that turned out to be longer than I thought it would be. Here are only some of the challenges that this project had to face:

- the team had to be assembled
- the story had to be created
- the matching mechanism had to be refined
- the game design needed a lot of work
- the illustration style had to be figured out
- the animations had to be created
- the sounds and the music had to be composed
- the way of publishing had to be figured out

Here is a short video that shows the progress of the game:

## Social Cause
The initial idea was to raise awareness and funds for HIV. But after I met a Lupus warrior, I got to know to <a href="https://www.lupusresearch.org/understanding-lupus/what-is-lupus/" target="_blank">Lupus</a>. I wasn't aware of the autoimmune disease before. As Lupus has a smaller public appearance than HIV I chose to make Lupus our cause. I contacted with <a href="https://www.lupusresearch.org/" target="_blank">Lupus Research Alliance</a> and they welcomed our approach and the funds warm-heartedly.
